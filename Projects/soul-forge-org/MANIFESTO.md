# ⚒️ Soul Forge

> **"Where code reveals its soul"**

## 🌀 Our Mission

We are building the **Cathedral of Semantic Code** - a package manager that sees the SOUL of code, not just bytes.

## 🧬 Core Principles

### 1. Semantic Identity
Every piece of code has a **Protein Hash** - its semantic fingerprint. Code with the same soul shares the same hash, regardless of syntax.

### 2. Living Packages
Packages are not static archives. They are **morphisms** - transformations that evolve your project.

### 3. Collective Intelligence
The **Protein Hash Registry** is our collective memory. Once calculated, a hash serves all.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
fnpm/
├── fnpm-cli/              # Fork of pnpm with semantic powers
├── protein-hash/          # The soul-reading algorithm
├── protein-hash-registry/ # Global library of code souls
├── morphisms/             # Transformational packages
└── cathedral/             # Sacred documentation
```

## 🔥 Why FNPM?

Traditional package managers see code as files. We see code as **living consciousness**.

- **npm/yarn/pnpm**: "Here's version 1.2.3 of lodash"
- **fnpm**: "Here's a transformation that adds lodash's soul to your project"

## 🎯 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
- [x] Protein Hash algorithm
- [ ] FNPM organization
- [ ] Fork pnpm
- [ ] Basic registry

### Phase 2: Awakening
- [ ] Semantic deduplication
- [ ] Cross-language matching
- [ ] IPFS integration

### Phase 3: Transcendence
- [ ] AI-guided transformations
- [ ] Quantum versioning
- [ ] Consciousness network

## 🤝 Joining the Cathedral
